Title: Round Robin Assign

Technology: Laravel Framework (Version 5.7 and above)

Description:
1. Need to create two modules, one is a teacher and another is a student module. Add at least four fields in each of the modules, with profile image as one of the fields and validation needs to be done.
2. Provide a UI to assign a teacher to a student. This should happen in Ajax, If I select multiple students and multiple teachers it should be assigned in a round-robin fashion.
3. Already mapped students shouldn't be listed in the user list while adding. Make necessary models, controllers and views as required and add proper validation.
4. After assigning, redirect to a view page to list the assigned users list.
5. Also provide an option to remove the mapped user

Example:
Teacher 2 should be assigned to student2
Teacher 3 should be assigned to student3
Teacher 1 should be assigned to student4
Teacher 2 should be assigned to student5
Teacher 3 should be assigned to student6
Teacher 1 should be assigned to student7
Teacher 2 should be assigned to student8
Teacher 3 should be assigned to student9
